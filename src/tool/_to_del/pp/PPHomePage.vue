      <!-- <div class="mt-1 row">
        Companies create Positive Pursuits through activities that benefit society, their customers, the environment, or that benefit their own employees above and beyond the company's normal responsibilities to provide decent working conditions and
        terms (see diagram below). These impacts help move society towards a future where people and the planet flourish, as described by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Future-Fit’s methodology, these kinds of activities
        are called Positive Pursuits (PP).

          The first step is to identify which of the company’s activities might lead to positive impact. First, you will create or edit a list of the company’s activities such as products, services, or projects that generate positive impact in the
          Manage section.
